    <h3>1. Potash Alum:-</h1>
    <p>Alum in its single form is also commonly known as potassium alum or potash alum. 
        The chemical formula for potash alum is <b>KAl(SO₄)₂·12H₂O</b>, and its chemical name is potassium aluminium sulphate.
         The common alum is a potash alum or potassium alum. The molar mass of the potash alum is 258.192 g/mol. 
         It can occur in a <strong>crystal</strong> form and smells like <b>metallic water</b>.
          Potash alum is also sometimes called white alum.</p>
    <h3>2. Soda Alum:-</h3>
    <p> It is also called sodium alum or just SAS, is a common item found in baking powder and as an acidulant in food. 
        Its chemical name is sodium aluminium sulphate, and has a molar mass of 458.28 g/mol.
         It exists in a <strong>crystal</strong> form and has a smell that of metallic water. 
         The chemical formula for sodium alum is <b>NaAl(SO₄)₂·12H₂O</b>.</p>
    <h3>3. Ammonium Alum:-</h3>
    <p>This type is referred to as ammonium sulphate alum. 
        Its more common name is AAS. 
        The chemical formula for potash alum is <b>NH3Al(SO4)2·12H2O</b>. 
        Ammonium alum has a molar mass of 132.14 g/mol. It also exists in a <strong>crystal</strong> form with a metallic water smell.</p>
    <h3>4. Chrome alum:-</h3>
    <p>The common abbreviation for chromium alum is CAS. 
        It is also known as chromium alum and has a chemical formula <b>KCr(SO4)2·12H2O</b>. 
        It is also known as chromium aluminium sulphate and has a molar mass of 283.22 g/mol. 
        Like other alums, it has a metallic water smell but mostly exists in a <strong>crystal form</strong>.</p>
