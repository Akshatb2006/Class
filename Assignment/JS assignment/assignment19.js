/*Question 1: Filter even numbers
Given an array of numbers: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10], use the ?filter?
 function to create a new array called ?evenNumbers? 
 that contains only even numbers from the original array.*/
 const arr = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 13, 17, 19];
let evenNumbers=arr.filter((e)=> e%2==0)
console.log(evenNumbers)

 /*You are given an array of student objects with the following structure:
[
{ name: "Alice", score: 88 },
{ name: "Bob", score: 92 },
{ name: "Charlie", score: 75 },
{ name: "David", score: 64 }
]
Create a JavaScript function that uses the ?map? 
function to transform this array into an array of objects with a "grade" property. 
The "grade" should be a string based on the following criteria:
A score of 90 or above is an "A".
A score between 80 and 89 (inclusive) is a "B".
A score between 70 and 79 (inclusive) is a "C".
A score below 70 is a "D".
Return the array of objects with grades.*/

/* Question 3: Reducing Inventory Value
    You have an array of product objects, where each object has properties ?name? 
    (string) and ?price? (number). Design a JavaScript function that uses the ?reduce? 
    function to calculate and return the total value of the entire inventory
     (the sum of the prices of all products).
    [
    { name: "Laptop", price: 800 },
    { name: "Phone", price: 600 },
     { name: "Tablet", price: 300 }

/*4.Testing Array Elements with every and some Functions:
Given an array of ages, write two separate functions using the 
`every` and `some` array methods. One function should check if 
all ages in the array are above 18, and the other should check 
if at least one age in the array is above 18. Provide examples 
and explanations for each function.*/
