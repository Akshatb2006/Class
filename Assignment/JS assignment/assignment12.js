/*Question 1:
Create a function named isEligibleForDiscount that takes these two parameters:
hasMembership (boolean) and
totalPurchase (number)
Implement the function to determine if a customer is eligible for a discount. 
The eligibility for discount depends on whether the customer has a membership as well as if their total purchase is greater than $100. 
Only when a customer meets both of these conditions, he/she is eligible for a discount. 
Return true if the given customer is eligible for discount else return false.*/

/*function isEligibleForDiscount(hasMembership, totalPurchase) {
    isEligibleForDiscount = (hasMembership && totalPurchase>100)?"eligible for discount":"false";
    return isEligibleForDiscount;
}
console.log(isEligibleForDiscount(false,90));
console.log(isEligibleForDiscount(true,120));*/


/*Imagine you're writing code for a timer that starts from 0 and increments every second. 
Write a function calculateTimeInSeconds that takes three parameters: hours, minutes, and seconds. 
Calculate and return the total time in seconds.*/

/*function calculateTimeInSeconds(hours, minutes, seconds){
        calculateTimeInSeconds= hours*60*60 + minutes*60 + seconds;
        return calculateTimeInSeconds;
}
console.log(calculateTimeInSeconds(7, 30, 45));*/

/*You're building a calculator app. 
Create a function calculateBMI that takes two parameters: weight (in kilograms) and height (in meters). 
Calculate and return the Body Mass Index (BMI) using the formula: BMI = weight / (height * height).*/

/*function calculateBMI(weight, height){
    calculateBMI= weight/(height*height);
    return calculateBMI;
}
console.log(calculateBMI(65, 1.70));*/

/*You're developing a game. 
Implement a function calculateFinalScore that takes three parameters: kills, objectives, and time (all integers). 
Calculate and return the final score using the formula: score = kills * 100 + objectives * 50 - time * 10.*/

/*function calculateFinalScore(kills, objectives, time){
    calculateFinalScore = kills * 100 + objectives * 50 - time * 10
      return calculateFinalScore;
