First of all I would like to address the word manipulation, in this article is inherently neutral. It’s up to the person whether he manipulates for good or bad because everyone manipulates everyone to some extent to get what we want for varying reasons.

Manipulation is natural for us human beings because if we don’t do it we will not survive. Our parents manipulated our choices when we were younger because we weren’t capable of thinking for ourselves. Our teachers manipulate us to get us to listen and behave in class. And our friends manipulate us to do all sorts of stuff, sometimes stupid and sometimes helpful.
